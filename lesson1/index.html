<h1>Metallica</h1>
<div>
    <p><strong>Metallica</strong> is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by
        vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its
        career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big
        four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises
        founding
        members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert
        Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists
        Ron
        McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of
        the
        band.</p>
